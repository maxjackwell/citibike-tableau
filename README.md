Citi-Bike Project README

Introduction
Before delving into the specifics of this project, it's essential to understand the journey that led to its creation. Initially, I embarked on this endeavor with the intent of gaining a deeper understanding of the underlying dataset. This journey began with the exploration of key figures and metrics that I found intriguing, leading to the creation of a Dashboard that highlighted various aspects of Citi-Bike data from the year 2014.

Citi-Bike Dashboard 2014
The "Citi-Bike Dashboard 2014" encapsulates a multitude of insights derived from the 2014 Citi-Bike dataset. It features a comprehensive map showcasing all Citi-Bike locations and their usage frequency throughout the year, juxtaposed with the average bike ride duration per location. Additionally, the dashboard delves into the identification of the most popular stations, with a focused graphical representation of the top three stations and their monthly usage trends.

Exploring Patterns and Behaviors
Diving deeper into the dataset, my exploration aimed to uncover patterns and behaviors associated with Citi-Bike stations and ridership. The first story within the dashboard presents a map detailing the starting locations of bike rides, providing an initial glimpse into the dynamics of bike usage across the city.

Transitioning to the second slide on the story, the focus shifted towards understanding the end locations of bike rides, shedding light on whether the Citi-Bike system predominantly facilitated one-way trips or full-circle rides. This exploration was crucial in deciphering the operational dynamics of the Citi-Bike system within NYC, specifically addressing my initial question: are the rides primarily one-way trips or full-circle rides?

In the third slide of my story, I delved into the tempo of bike rides by identifying and analyzing the top 10 most frequently used locations. This analysis aimed to answer the question of where and why these locations are the most popular. Notably, these locations predominantly cluster in the central part of Manhattan, reflecting shorter ride durations and higher usage rates. However, a notable outlier, the West St & Chambers St location, intrigued further investigation due to its longer ride durations.

Delving beyond the data, an exploration into the societal context surrounding the West St & Chambers St location uncovered a vibrant neighborhood filled with coffee shops, boutiques, parks, and scenic bike routes along the city's edge. This context shed light on the factors contributing to longer Citi-Bike rides in certain areas.

Seasonal Patterns and Ride Durations
At the outset of my investigation, I wondered when are the most popular times for Citi-Bike rides and why that might be. One of my initial hypotheses was that shorter ride durations could be attributed to users' preferences for quick rides during the hottest months, favoring shorter outdoor activities next to the steamy pavement. Conversely, I theorized that ride durations might be longer during cooler non-Winter months when it's more preferable to be outdoors in the sun, leading to extended bike rides.

The summer month of July witnessed the highest ride frequency, accompanied by shorter average ride durations compared to surrounding summer months. This observation hinted at user behaviors and preferences during peak summer months, agreeing with the assumption that longer rides occur during cooler periods. Another wildcard was the spike in February, to which after research makes no sense because not only is February on record a snowy month, the 2014 February overall, had 11 days where the high temperature did not get above freezing. While they also had a few unseasonably warm days, the extended periods of extreme cold brought the city's average monthly temperature down to 31.7°F. That is 3.3°F below normal. The only potential explanation is that because February had the least overall rides, on these unseasonably warm days, users went out for longer bike rides on average - shifting the overall month data in that favor.
